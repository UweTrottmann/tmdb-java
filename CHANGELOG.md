0.10.1 *(2016-03-15)*
--------------------

 * Use `ReleaseDatesResults` when using `append_to_response` to get movie information. Thanks to @urizev.

0.10.0 *(2016-03-04)*
--------------------

 * Add `/movie/{id}/release_dates` thanks to @urizev.
 * Deprecate `/movie/{id}/releases`, see [update post](https://plus.google.com/+TravisBellTMDb/posts/4uNG5uSwtfe).

 * Drop method variants (e.g. movie summary call with just a TMDb id). Use the full parameter variant and supply `null`
   for non-required query parameters.

 * Switch to JUnit 4 for testing.
 * Update `retrofit` to 1.9.0, which allows to drop the `okhttp-urlconnection` dependency.

 * Limited fest dependency to test scope.

0.4.0 *(2014-03-09)*
